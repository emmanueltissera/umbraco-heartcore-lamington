# Lord Lamington using Umbraco Heartcore

[Lord Lamington](https://heartcore.lordlamington.com/) is a demo website for showcasing the multi-language features of [Umbraco Heartcore](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-heartcore/). The code herein powers the website and is written in .NET Core 2.2.

## What's Umbraco Heartcore?
It's headless. It's Content-as-a-Service (CaaS). See my blog post on the [Umbraco Heartcore Launch](https://www.luminary.com/blog/umbraco-heartcore-launch) for more details.

## Trying it out

Clone this repo and run it using Visual Studio 2019. 

## Access to the content repo

If you need access to the Content API, please DM me on Twitter [@dAmazingNut](https://twitter.com/dAmazingNut). I can provide the project alias so that you can play with populated content. It's not a big secret though 😀

## Warning

The code is not production ready and is more suited to understand the concepts. Note that it's work in progress.
